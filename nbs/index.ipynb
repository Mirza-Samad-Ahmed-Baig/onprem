Confidence scores are used to sort and prune candidate answers before returning results. The entire workflow can be implemented with only three lines of code using ktrain's SimpleQA module. This system allows for the submission of natural language questions and receives exact answers, as demonstrated in the provided example.

    "### Using Hugging Face Transformers Instead of Llama.cpp\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the LLM backend employed by **OnPrem.LLM** is [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), which requires models in [GGUF format](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/gguf). As of v0.5.0, it is now possible to use [Hugging Face transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) as the LLM backend instead. This is accomplished by using the `model_id` parameter (instead of supplying a `model_url` argument). In the example below, we run the [Llama-3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# llama-cpp-python does NOT need to be installed when using model_id parameter\n",
    "llm = LLM(model_id=\"hugging-quants/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-AWQ-INT4\", device_map='cuda')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to more easily use any model on the Hugging Face hub in [SafeTensors format](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index) provided it can be loaded with the Hugging Face `transformers.pipeline`. Note that, when using the `model_id` parameter, the `prompt_template` is set automatically by `transformers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Llama-3.1 model loaded above was quantized using [AWQ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/quantization/awq), which allows the model to fit onto smaller GPUs (e.g., laptop GPUs with 6GB of VRAM) similar to the default GGUF format. AWQ models will require the [autoawq](https://pypi.org/project/autoawq/) package to be installed: `pip install autoawq` (AWQ only supports Linux system, including Windows Subsystem for Linux). If you do need to load a model that is not quantized, you can supply a quantization configuration at load time (known as \"inflight quantization\"). In the following example, we load an unquantized [Zephyr-7B-beta model](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta) that will be quantized during loading to fit on GPUs with as little as 6GB of VRAM:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig\n",
    "quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n",
    "    load_in_4bit=True,\n",
    "    bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",\n",
    "    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=\"float16\",\n",
    "    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,\n",
    ")\n",
    "llm = LLM(model_id=\"HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta\", device_map='cuda', \n",
    "          model_kwargs={\"quantization_config\":quantization_config})\n",
    "```\n",
    "When supplying a `quantization_config`, the [bitsandbytes](https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/installation) library, a lightweight Python wrapper around CUDA custom functions, in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and 8 & 4-bit quantization functions, is used.  There are ongoing efforts by the bitsandbytes team to support multiple backends in addition to CUDA. If you receive errors related to bitsandbytes, please refer to the [bitsandbytes documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/installation). "
